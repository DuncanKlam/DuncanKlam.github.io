title: Introducing Klamworks
---

[DuncanKlam](http://github.com/DuncanKlam) is my Github username and Klamworks are my projects! Someday I hope to turn Klamworks into a global library for all to engage with and utilize the wonderful things I have built, but since I have yet to build anything amazing, feel free to check out these projects in the meantime!

## Miscellaneous Klamworks


[ToDoList Application](https://github.com/DuncanKlam/ToDoListApplication): This app brings up a GUI using Java Swing that can be used to create, edit, and delete ToDo items on a local database. They can then be uploaded to a web server, and synced from the server to the database. This was created for a class.

[Workout-Generator](https://github.com/DuncanKlam/Workout-Generator): This app creates a GUI using Java Swing that allows you to generate a random workout after selecting some basic inputs about type and intensity of workout. This was a personal project.   

[CalculatorUI](https://github.com/DuncanKlam/CalculatorUIInClass): A very simple graphic calculator in Java Swing with basic calculator function + memory. This was made for a class.  

[DecimalBinaryHexadecimalConverter](https://github.com/DuncanKlam/DecimalBinaryHexadecimalConverter): A simple java program to convert between Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal units. This was a personal project.    

[Wikipedia_Revision_Viewer](https://github.com/DuncanKlam/WikipediaRevisionViewerRedux): This program launches a GUI using Java Swing to see the most recent revisions on any given wiki page using the Wikipedia Revisions API. This was created for a class.
