## Life

I was born in Cleveland, Ohio (Go Buckeyes!)

I lived most of my life in Holland, Michigan where I went to [West Ottawa High School](https://www.westottawa.net/).
 At West Ottawa I participated in the [Robotics Club](http://www.team141.net/) (Go [WOBOT](http://www.team141.net/images/wobot%20logo_km2016-01.png?crc=3918792164)!!) as well as the series of broadcasting classes that output daily news shows for the school: [WOBN](http://www.wobnonline.com/)

I currently [live](https://www.instagram.com/klemmchowdah/) in Muncie, Indiana where I attend [Ball State University](https://www.bsu.edu/).
I am seeking to obtain a BA in Telecommunications with a focus in Video Production and a BS in Computer Science

## Work Experience

Something I pride myself on is that since I was able to pick up a shovel and help my grandpa dig holes, I have been employed and in the workforce (though that work experience is not reflected here)

## Technical Skills

The world of programming is constantly evolving and changing in new and interesting ways. There are a million and one ways to go about doing anything in a single language, let alone multiple languages. So, for me to say I have mastered any of these languages/softwares would be foolish. I can, however, confidently say I am fluent in some and am always learning others!

Fluent in: [Java](https://www.java.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (lol), [MIT Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) (lol again)

Learning: [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/)/[Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), [Linux](https://www.linux.org/), [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)

In my free time (which is not much) I enjoy learning how to code new and better things as well as browse [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/klemmchowdah), and [pwn some noobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/pjohex/sharpshooting_pre_bocek/) in [Apex Legends](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends)

Thanks for reading!
