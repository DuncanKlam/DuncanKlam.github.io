  Hey there! Thanks for the interest in me! It means a lot. Take a look at some quick aspects of my life!
</p>

<h2 id="life">Life</h2>

<p>I was born in Cleveland, Ohio (Go Buckeyes!)</p>

<p>I lived most of my life in Holland, Michigan where I went to <a href="https://www.westottawa.net/">West Ottawa High School</a>.
 At West Ottawa I participated in the <a href="http://www.team141.net/">Robotics Club</a> (Go <a href="http://www.team141.net/images/wobot%20logo_km2016-01.png?crc=3918792164">WOBOT</a>!!) as well as the series of broadcasting classes that output daily news shows for the school: <a href="http://www.wobnonline.com/">WOBN</a></p>

<p>I currently <a href="https://www.instagram.com/klemmchowdah/">live</a> in Muncie, Indiana where I attend <a href="https://www.bsu.edu/">Ball State University</a>.
I am seeking to obtain a BA in Telecommunications with a focus in Video Production and a BS in Computer Science</p>

<h2 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h2>

<p>Something I pride myself on is that since I was able to pick up a shovel and help my grandpa dig holes, I have been employed and in the workforce (though that work experience is not reflected here)</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.redrobin.com/">Red Robin</a> - <em>Line Cook</em> - 4 years - 2016-2020</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ontheborder.com/">On The Border</a> - <em>Line Cook</em> - 1 year - 2019-2020</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.lowes.com/">Loweâ€™s</a> - <em>Customer Service Associate</em> - 1 year - 2020-Present</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-skills">Technical Skills</h2>

<p>The world of programming is constantly evolving and changing in new and interesting ways. There are a million and one ways to go about doing anything in a single language, let alone multiple languages. So, for me to say I have mastered any of these languages/softwares would be foolish. I can, however, confidently say I am fluent in some and am always learning others!</p>

<p>Fluent in: <a href="https://www.java.com/">Java</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDE</a>, <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> (lol), <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a></p>

<p>Learning: <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>/<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/">Git Bash</a>, <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>, <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>, <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS</a></p>

<p>In my free time (which is not much) I enjoy learning how to code new and better things as well as browse <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/klemmchowdah">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/pjohex/sharpshooting_pre_bocek/">pwn some noobs</a> in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a></p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
